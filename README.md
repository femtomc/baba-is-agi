The comparison shows how different agent architectures handle varying puzzle complexity. The demo agent uses simple pathfinding while the Claude Code agent can reason about game mechanics and display its thinking process in the UI.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This project includes a level loader and sprite system that can work with official Baba Is You game files. These features **require you to own the game on Steam**. The project works without these files using custom ASCII sprites and built-in environments.

## Features

- Complete game engine with dynamic rule system
- 120+ objects from the original game
- Custom ASCII-based sprites (always available)
- Level loader for official Baba Is You levels (requires game ownership)
- Gym-like environment API for easy integration
- Simple agent interface - just implement `get_action()`
- Claude Code agent with reasoning display in UI
- 14 built-in environments of varying difficulty

## Installation

```bash
# Install pixi
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Install dependencies
pixi install
```

### Optional: Official Game Content (Requires Game Ownership)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: The following features require you to own Baba Is You on Steam:
- Loading official game sprites
- Loading official level files (.l format)

If you own the game on Steam:
```bash
# Copy official sprites from your Steam installation
pixi run setup-sprites
```

The game will automatically use custom ASCII sprites if official sprites are not available.

## Quick Start

### Play Interactively

```bash
pixi run play
```

Controls: Arrow keys/WASD to move, R to reset, Q to quit

### Play with AI Agents

```bash
# Watch a random agent play
pixi run agent-random

# Run demo agent with pathfinding
pixi run agent-demo

# Run Claude Code agent with reasoning display (requires claude-code CLI)
pixi run agent-claude

# List all available environments
pixi run list-envs
```

### Load Official Levels

**‚ö†Ô∏è Requires game ownership**: This feature only works if you own Baba Is You on Steam.

```python
from baba.level_loader import LevelLoader
from baba.registration import Registry

loader = LevelLoader()  # Automatically finds Steam installation
registry = Registry()

# Load level from official game files
try:
    grid = loader.load_level("baba", 0, registry)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Official levels not found. Please own the game on Steam.")
```

## Creating Custom Agents

The project uses a Gym-like API, making it easy to create agents:

#### Basic Agent Example

```python
from baba import Agent, make

class MyAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("My Custom Agent")
        
    def get_action(self, observation):
        # Analyze grid state and return action
        # observation is a Grid object with game state
        # Return one of: "up", "down", "left", "right", "wait"
        return "right"

# Create environment and agent
env = make("simple")
agent = MyAgent()

# Play one episode with visualization
stats = agent.play_episode(env, render=True)
print(f"Won: {stats['won']}, Steps: {stats['steps']}")

# Or play many episodes for evaluation
stats = agent.play_episodes(env, num_episodes=100, render=False)
print(f"Win rate: {stats['win_rate']*100:.1f}%")
```

### Environment API (Gym-like)

```python
# Reset environment
obs = env.reset()  # Returns Grid object

# Take a step
obs, reward, done, info = env.step("right")
# reward: 1.0 (win), -1.0 (loss), 0.0 (otherwise)
# done: True if episode ended
# info: dict with 'won', 'lost', 'steps'

# Render current state
img = env.render()  # Returns RGB array
```

#### Claude Code Agent

The project includes a Claude Code agent that uses AI to play the game:

```python
from agents.claude_code_agent import ClaudeCodeAgent

agent = ClaudeCodeAgent(verbose=True)
# Agent will display its reasoning in the UI:
# "Moving toward flag", "Need to push rock", etc.
```

## Game Rules

Rules are formed by arranging text blocks:
- `BABA IS YOU` - Control Baba
- `FLAG IS WIN` - Touch flag to win
- `WALL IS STOP` - Walls block movement
- `ROCK IS PUSH` - Rocks can be pushed
- `BABA IS WALL` - Transform Baba into walls
