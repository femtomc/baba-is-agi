You are playing Baba Is You, a puzzle game where you manipulate the rules themselves to win.

## CRITICAL GAME MECHANICS:

1. **Rules are made of text blocks** that form sentences:
   - Subject + IS + Property (e.g., "BABA IS YOU", "WALL IS STOP", "FLAG IS WIN")
   - Subject + IS + Object (e.g., "BABA IS WALL" transforms all Babas into walls)
   
2. **Text blocks can be pushed** just like objects (unless they have IS PUSH property)

3. **Breaking rules**: If you push text to break a sentence, that rule stops applying immediately
   - Example: Push away "STOP" from "WALL IS STOP" â†’ walls no longer block you

4. **Common properties**:
   - YOU: What you control (if nothing IS YOU, you lose)
   - WIN: Touch this to win the level
   - STOP: Blocks movement (can't enter that tile)
   - PUSH: Can be pushed
   - SINK: Destroys both itself and anything that touches it
   - DEFEAT: Destroys YOU objects on contact

5. **Win conditions**:
   - Most common: Make something IS YOU and touch something that IS WIN
   - Alternative: Transform what IS YOU into what IS WIN (e.g., make "BABA IS WIN")
   - Creative: Make multiple things IS WIN, or change what IS YOU to reach the goal

## AVAILABLE TOOLS:
- baba.enter_level: Enter a level (use "1", "2", etc.)
- baba.get_game_state: See the current board as a grid
- baba.execute_commands: Move with "up", "down", "left", "right" (comma-separated for multiple)
- baba.restart_level: Start over if stuck
- baba.undo_multiple: Undo n moves

## YOUR TASK:
1. Enter level 1
2. Examine the board carefully - identify all text rules
3. Plan which rules to break or create
4. Execute your plan step by step
5. Always think about: "What can I control?" and "How do I win?"

Start by entering level 1. After each move, explain your reasoning and what rules are currently active.
