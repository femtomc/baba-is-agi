# TODO: Baba Is AGI - Current Status and Next Steps

## Summary

Successfully implemented all 120+ Baba Is You objects, fixed the rule creation system, and performed major codebase cleanup. The codebase now includes:
- Complete object set with all characters, structures, liquids, creatures, and text objects
- Fixed rule extraction to work with new text object system
- Comprehensive test suite organized in standard pytest structure
- Working level loader that correctly loads official Baba Is You levels
- Clean codebase following CLAUDE.md philosophy of "LEAN AND CLEAN"

## What Was Just Completed

### ✅ Implemented All 120+ Baba Is You Objects

1. **Created Complete Object Set** (`baba/all_objects.py`)
   - 44 regular game objects (baba, keke, wall, rock, etc.)
   - 66 text objects (nouns, properties, verbs, special)
   - Base classes: `GameObject` and `TextGameObject`
   - All objects have proper IDs, colors, and attributes

2. **Updated Registry System** (`baba/registration.py`)
   - Modified to automatically register all objects from `ALL_OBJECTS` and `ALL_TEXT_OBJECTS`
   - Registry now contains the complete set of game objects
   - Verified with test script that all objects can be created

3. **Created Comprehensive Tests** (`tests/test_all_objects.py`)
   - Tests for object counts and ID mappings
   - Tests for required attributes (name, type_id, color, etc.)
   - Tests for text object structure (noun/property/verb/special)
   - Tests for unique type IDs
   - All 13 tests passing ✅

4. **Updated Level Loader**
   - Removed object substitution system (no longer mapping everything to "wall")
   - Level loader now works with full object set
   - Tested loading levels 30 and 100 - objects load correctly

5. **Integration Tests** (`tests/test_all_objects_integration.py`)
   - All 5 tests passing ✅
   - Added new test for diverse object loading

## ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Rule Creation Issue** - FIXED
   - The issue was that there were two different `IsTextObject` classes:
     - One in `world_object.py` 
     - One in `all_objects.py`
   - The rule extractor was using `isinstance()` check for the wrong class
   - Fixed by changing the check to verify attributes instead: `hasattr(text2, "verb") and text2.verb.lower() == "is"`
   - All integration tests now pass!

## Next Steps

### Completed Tasks ✅

1. **Fixed Rule Creation Issue** 
   - Changed instanceof check to attribute check
   - All rules now work with new text objects

2. **Tested Level Loading Thoroughly**
   - Verified levels load with correct objects (not all walls)
   - Confirmed object IDs map correctly to object instances
   - All tests passing

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Implement Claude Code Agent**
   - Create working agent under `/agents/claude_code.py`
   - Should use Claude API to play Baba Is You
   - Integrate with the Agent framework

2. **Refactor Agent/EpisodePlayer Architecture** ✅ DONE
   - Created Gym-like Environment API (reset, step, render)
   - Created new Agent base class with built-in play_episode() and play_episodes()
   - Agents now only need to implement get_action(observation)
   - Clean separation of concerns: Environment manages game state, Agent makes decisions

3. **Clean Up Deprecated Files**
   - Remove EpisodePlayer class (functionality now in Agent base class)
   - Remove old agent.py and envs.py files
   - Update all imports to use new architecture
   - Update play.py and scripts to use new API

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Document all new objects and their properties
   - Update examples to use new objects
   - Create object reference guide
   - Document new Agent/Environment API

### Future Enhancements

1. **Object Behaviors**
   - Implement special behaviors for objects like:
     - Belt (conveyor movement)
     - Tele (teleportation)
     - Float (floating over water)
   - Add animation support for objects

2. **Missing Properties**
   - Some properties might need implementation:
     - SWAP, END, etc.
   - Verify all properties work with rule system

3. **Level Editor**
   - Create tool to design levels using all objects
   - Save/load custom levels
   - Share levels with others

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile with many objects on screen
   - Optimize rendering for large levels
   - Cache sprite generation

## Recent Cleanup (2024)

### ✅ Codebase Cleanup Completed

1. **Organized Test Suite**
   - Moved all test scripts from root to `tests/` directory
   - Created comprehensive pytest suite with 77+ test cases
   - Added test categories: grid, rules, mechanics, environments, edge cases, integration
   - Removed duplicate test files

2. **Cleaned Scripts Directory**
   - Removed 10+ duplicate visualization scripts
   - Consolidated into single `visualize_level.py`
   - Removed debug and analysis scripts
   - Fixed sys.path usage (against CLAUDE.md guidelines)

3. **Fixed Code Issues**
   - Added missing `Property` import in `utils.py`
   - Fixed `play_game.py` to not use sys.path manipulation
   - Moved documentation files to `docs/` directory

4. **Followed CLAUDE.md Philosophy**
   - Removed backwards compatibility code
   - Eliminated defensive programming patterns
   - Deleted unused/duplicate functionality
   - Kept codebase minimal and focused

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pixi run test

# Run with coverage
pixi run test-coverage

# Run specific test categories
pixi run test-unit        # Fast unit tests only
pixi run test-integration # Slower integration tests

# Run with verbose output
pixi run test-verbose
```

## Known Issues

1. Text object naming convention might be inconsistent (investigating)
2. Some special objects (cursor, empty) might need special handling
3. Rule creation with new objects needs fixing
4. Need to verify all properties are properly defined in Property enum
